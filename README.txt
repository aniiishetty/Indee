Video Editing Script
This script allows you to edit a video by adding a red triangle to it for a specified duration, and then overlaying a white square on the video for its full duration. The script is written in Python and utilizes the MoviePy library for video editing.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
MoviePy library installed. You can install it via pip:
Copy code
pip install moviepy
Usage
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the Directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned.

Run the Script: Use the following command to run the script:


python main.py <input_video> <start_time> <end_time> <output_video>
<input_video>: Path to the input video file.
<start_time>: Start time in the format hh:mm:ss where you want the red triangle to appear.
<end_time>: End time in the format hh:mm:ss where you want the red triangle to disappear.
<output_video>: Path to save the output video file.
Example:

python main.py input_video.mp4 00:01:30 00:01:40 output_video.mp4

How It Works

The script first loads the input video clip.
It then inserts a red triangle on the video clip between the specified start and end times.
After that, it overlays a white square on the entire duration of the video.
Finally, it writes the modified video clip to the output file.
Note: 
Make sure the input video file exists and the specified start and end times are within the duration of the video.
